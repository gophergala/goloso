# Goloso

_Goloso is an Ansible callback server over NSQ_

The idea here it to have an automatic bootstrap mechanism using a callback system to run Ansible playbooks remotely.

Whenever a instance goes up, it posts a message saying “hi guys, I’m alive” to a central message broker. Them comes **Goloso**, our engine which consumes from a “bootstrap” topic and orders the playbook run into that fresh new and sweet instance.

This goloso points to a single Ansible playbook, the master entrypoint. This playbook knows what to choose based on the variables/tags received.


## System Overview

The system has three main components.

* The message producer or new instance which will post a JSON message to NSQ.

* NSQ, the message broker.

* Goloso, conuming messages from NSQ and running Ansible playbooks.
